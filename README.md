# NTL â€“ Network Time Link

**NTL** is a Kotlin-based Android prototype demonstrating a power-efficient communication and localisation protocol for industrial IoT environments (IIoT).

This project models short-range wireless communication between **battery-powered** and **wired** telematics devices.
Wired devices (e.g., vehicle-mounted telematics units) act as *mobile sinks*, offering nearby nodes access to time, location and cloud connectivity, offloading high-energy tasks like GPS and LTE.

## ðŸ§ª Prototype Overview

Current modules include:
- `BatteryApp`: Kotlin Android app representing battery-powered nodes
- `WiredApp`: Kotlin Android app representing wired telematics units
- `Common`: Shared code and utilities used by both apps

The project demonstrates:
- BLE Advertising and GATT communication patterns
- Secure data offloading using ECDH key exchange and AES-GCM encryption
- Device registry concepts

## ðŸ“˜ About NTL

NTL is designed for scenarios where:
- Devices operate under a unified trust framework
- Wired mobile nodes provide reliable relay gateways
- Minor network delay and accuracy trade-offs are acceptable
